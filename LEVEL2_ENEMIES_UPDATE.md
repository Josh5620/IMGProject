- Supports idle, run/walk, and attack states
- Non-looping attack animations with proper timing
- Automatic frame flipping for facing direction

### Combat System
- Melee enemies (Skeleton, Mushroom): Close-range attacks with cooldowns
- Ranged enemy (Flying Eye): Long-range projectile attacks
- Each enemy has unique attack cooldown timing
- Particle effects trigger on attack animation

### AI Behavior
- Standard patrol when player not spotted
- Chase player when in sight range
- Attack when in attack range
- Flying Eye ignores gravity and hovers above ground

## Code Structure Improvements

1. **Removed unused enemy classes:**
   - WolfEnemy
   - ShadowCreature
   - DarkEnchanter
   - Level2Boss
   - Old Skeleton and FlyingMonster implementations

2. **Added particle system:**
   - Three new particle types
   - Integrated with enemy attacks
   - Proper lifecycle management (update/draw/cleanup)

3. **Consistent with Level 1 style:**
   - Same animation system
   - Same AI structure
   - Same update/draw patterns

4. **Proper inheritance:**
   - All inherit from Level2Enemy base class
   - Override methods for special behaviors
   - Clean separation of concerns

## Usage Example

```python
# Create enemies
skeleton = Skeleton(100, 500)
mushroom = MutatedMushroom(300, 500)
flying_eye = FlyingEye(500, 400)

# Update in game loop
skeleton.update(player, dt=1.0, obstacles=obstacles, scroll_offset=camera_x)
mushroom.update(player, dt=1.0, obstacles=obstacles, scroll_offset=camera_x)
flying_eye.update(player, dt=1.0, obstacles=obstacles, scroll_offset=camera_x)

# Draw
skeleton.draw(surface)
mushroom.draw(surface)
flying_eye.draw(surface)
```

## Asset Requirements

Ensure these sprite sheets exist:
- `assets/Level2/Skeleton/` - Idle.png, Walk.png, Attack.png
- `assets/Level2/Mushroom/` - Idle.png, Run.png, Attack.png
- `assets/Level2/Flying eye/` - Flight.png, Attack.png

All animations are one-row sprite sheets with frames arranged horizontally.

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Sound effects for each attack type
- Damage numbers floating on hit
- Death animations
- Special enemy variants
- Boss versions with enhanced abilities
